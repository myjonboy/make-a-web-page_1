    <h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web &#38; HTML</h2>

    <section class="blueWrapper"> <!-- Pieces of the Web -->
      <p><b>Pieces of the Web</b><br />
        There are four main pieces of the world wide web.  Each piece does something a little bit different, though all the pieces are important.  Without any of these pieces, the web just won't work.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browser
          <ul>
            <li>The browser is the part with which most people are familiar.  It is your Chrome, Firefox, or Opera.  It is what translates all that nasty code and makes it pretty and usable to the everyman.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Internets (World Wide Web)
          <ul>
            <li>The World Wide Web is the network.  Essentially, the connection between your computer/browser and the servers that house all those little bits of code.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
          <ul>
            <li>HTTP is the doorbell of the internet.  It allows your computer/browser to properly communicate that it wants information from the server.  Without this, the server will have no idea what is going on.  HTTP is having your neighbor over for the big game...without it, it's someone robbing your home.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Servers - computers in closets
          <ul>
            <li>Servers are like a bank.  Your browser, through the help of HTTP, has the key to a specific webpage/safety deposit box that allows you to open said box.  They house the trillions of websites that exist on the internet and give you access to specific sites when you want to view these sites.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section class="blueWrapper"> <!-- A Few Tags -->
      <p><b>A Few Tags</b><br />
        These are a few introductory tags which we learned from Lesson 1.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Block Level Tags
          <ul>
            <li>These elements have an invisible wrapper around them that can be manipulated using CSS and JavaScript
              <ul>
                <li>Paragraph</li>
                <li>Div</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Inline Tags
          <ul>
            <li>These tags have no such manipulatible wrapper and are found "<em>in the line</em>" of the code itself
              <ul>
                <li>Anchor (href)</li>
                <li>Strong/Bold</li>
                <li>Emphasis</li>
                <li>Break</li>
                <li>Span</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

    <section class = "blueWrapper">
      <p><b>Computers Are Stupid</b><br />
              The code has to be written <em>exactly</em> the way a computer can understand then or things can go horribly wrong.  This is known as correct <b>syntax</b>.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>

    <section> <!-- Developer Tools -->
      <p><b>Developer Tools</b><br />
        Using most internet browsers, you will find a tool known as Developer Tools.  This is a very handy application that can help decipher the code of a website.  It can show the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as allow you to manipulate the code of another website and see the results in real-time.  A great way to learn how/why a developer coded a specific site the way he did.
      </p>
    </section> <!-- END Developer Tools -->

    <section> <!-- HTML Structure -->
      <p><b>HTML Structure</b><br />
        HTML is coded in a form known as a tree.  This usually means that elements are indented however many times deep they are within the structure.  For example: Body -> Section -> Paragraph...the paragraph is indented twice as it is two levels deep within the tree.
      </p>
    </section> <!-- END HTML Structure -->

    <section> <!-- Boxes EVERYWHERE! -->
      <p><b>Boxes EVERYWHERE!</b><br />
        Webpages are essentially boxes within boxes.  The entire structure of a webpage is a big box with smaller boxes within it.  This can make positioning items relatively easy, despite Float's best efforts.  It also helps to make grid structures and responsive design simpler than it sounds.
      </p>
    </section> <!-- END Boxes EVERYWHERE! -->

    <section> <!-- Text Editors -->
      <p><b>Text Editors</b><br />
        Programming Text Editors are programs made specifically for writing code such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  They have tremendious advantages over simply using TextEdit or Word and will help you save a great deal of time when coding.  There are a myriad of different text editors from Sublime Text to Brackets to Dreamweaver.  Pick any you like as the end result will hopefully be the same no matter which you choose.

    <h2>Lesson 3: Best Practices &#38; Beautification</h2>
    <section> <!-- Don't Stutter -->
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>Don't Stutter</b><br />
        When you write code, you should make a concious effort not to repeat yourself.  There are many reasons for this best practice:</p>
        <ol style="margin-top: 5px;">
          <li>Repetition typically causes errors.  As you continue to try and replicate a task or style, inevitably you will mess somthing up.  By limiting repetition you can avoid many of these types of mistakes.</li>
          <li>Code size and legibility.  The longer your code, the heavier your website or program will be and the longer it will take to load.  This also creates code that can be cumbersome to difficult to read, especially if you have to hunt down many bugs.</li>
        </ol>
    </section> <!-- END Don't Stutter -->

    <section> <!-- CSS -->
      <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b><br />
        Cascading Style Sheets are what turn a website from an ugly duckling into a swan.  It is tremendiously powerful and can add "style" to any eliment on a webpage from font to background colors to element positions and beyond!
